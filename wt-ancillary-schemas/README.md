## Build

We are using a non-standard notation for referencing external Open API documents,
such as `$ref: '@windingtree/wt-shared-schemas/swagger.yaml#/components/schemas/EthereumAddressType'`.
These references are resolved and inlined during the build phase.

Version number is set during build phase as well.
